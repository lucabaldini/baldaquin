plasduino
=========

`plasduino <https://pythonhosted.org/plasduino/>`_ is an old project that has
been running in the didactic labs at the University of Pisa since about 2013, and
is currently not maintained (nor maintainable)---if you are into vintage stuff,
you can glance through the original `repository <https://bitbucket.org/lbaldini/plasduino/src/main/>`_.

With our youthful exuberance, we thought we would do something awesome, and general,
and extensible---something that would go viral. (Sure...) Needless to say, the
project did not take off, although it served us well with the first-year Physics
students for more than ten years. But we are now taking this chance to resurrect
the project (or at least part of it) and adapt into this new framework.

plasduino is basically a collection of arduino sketches running onto an arduino
uno (with a small custom board plugged on top), along with a graphical user
interface to control the data acquisition.
